STOCK RULES

1. If you use my stock, please inform me- comment on stock you used or send me a note with link to your artwork.
2. You have to credit me in your description.*
3. You have my permission for DA prints as long as you credit me.
4. If you want to use my stock outside DA- you can, but tell me about it. I want to know where is my stock!



DO NOT distribute my stocks outside DA.
DO NOT claim these stocks are yours. Don't be a thief.


*How to do that?
Don't leave only http://valkiria-stock.deviantart.com/ , please. (It will be only [link] )
You can use :iconvalkiria-stock : and It will be my avatar
or :devvalkiria-stock : and It will be full name of my account

Thank you.
